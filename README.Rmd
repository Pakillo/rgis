## Installation

This package depends on package [`velox`](https://github.com/hunzikp/velox), which has been removed from CRAN as of 2020-03-17 (see [here](https://github.com/hunzikp/velox/issues/43) for more info). While it (hopefully) comes back to CRAN, you will need to install `velox` **before** attempting to install `rgis`, like this (thanks @lbusett for the tip):

``` r
devtools::install_version("velox", version = "0.2.0")
```

Then you can install `rgis`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Pakillo/rgis")
```


## Current functions:

- `ungzip`: Decompress gzip files.

- `fast_extract`: Fast extraction of raster values for points and polygons.

- `fast_mask`: Fast masking of raster values based on another raster or polygon layer.
